# Description: The actions module.

# The actions module contains the functions that are called when a command is executed.
# Each function takes 3 parameters:
# - game: the game object
# - list_of_words: the list of words in the command
# - number_of_parameters: the number of parameters expected by the command
# The functions return True if the command was executed successfully, False otherwise.
# The functions print an error message if the number of parameters is incorrect.
# The error message is different depending on the number of parameters expected by the command.


# The error message is stored in the MSG0 and MSG1 variables and formatted with the command_word variable, the first word in the command.
# The MSG0 variable is used when the command does not take any parameter.
MSG0 = "\nLa commande '{command_word}' ne prend pas de paramètre.\n"
# The MSG1 variable is used when the command takes 1 parameter.
MSG1 = "\nLa commande '{command_word}' prend 1 seul paramètre.\n"
# The MSG2 variable is used when the command go is used with an invalid direction.
MSG2 = "\nLa direction '{direction}' non reconnue."
# The MSG3 variable is used when the command back is used with an empty history.
MSG3 = "\nL'historique est vide."
# The MSG4 variable is used when the command take is used with a wrong object.
MSG4 = "\nL'objet '{item}' n'est pas dans {inventaire_ou_pièce}.\n"
